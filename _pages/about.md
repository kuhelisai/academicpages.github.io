<p style="color:red;">This website is currently under construction. I try frequently to keep my LinkedIn profile up to date. Till this website is ready, for nearly up to date information, you may consider visiting my Linkedin profile at <b>https://www.linkedin.com/in/kuhelisai/.</b></p>



Welcome to my homepage! I am Kuheli Sai, a Computer and Data Science Researcher. I am pursuing a Ph.D. from the School of Computing and Information (SCI) at the University of Pittsburgh (Pitt). My research interest includes (i) Blockchain Security, (ii) IoT and Network Traffic Anomaly Detection, (iii) Healthcare Data Security, (iv) Critical Infrastructure Security, and (v) Applied ML. Prior to joining the Ph.D. program at Pitt, I have earned my Engineering Master's Degree (M.Tech. in Information Technology) from the Indian Institute of Engineering Science and Technology (IIEST), Shibpur, Engineering Bachelor's Degree (B.Tech. in Computer Science & Engineering) from West Bengal University of Technology (WBUT), Kolkata and also did a Software Engineering job at Cognizant Technology Solutions (CTS) Corp.

I support diversity and inclusion initiatives in computing. In this regard, I have contributed and/or served as the Board Member/Program Committee Member/Area Chair/Session Chair/Award Reviewer to several conferences/organizations including N2Women, Grace Hopper Celebration (GHC), Women in Machine Learning (WiML), National Centre for Women and Information Technology (NCWIT), Women in CyberSecurity (WiCyS), Black in AI (BAI) at NeurIPS, Latinx in AI (LXAI) at NeurIPS etc. Alongside, I am one of the mentors to several female college students in India interested in pursuing higher studies in India and abroad as part of an initiative by the United States Department of State project: “Women for Women: Supporting Each Other To Build Sustainable Careers”.

I have been working and doing research on network traffic anomaly detection in the Scientific Computing Information Security Research Group at the United States Department of Energy (DoE) National Laboratory-Fermilab as 2020, and 2019 Computational Science Summer Research Intern.

I am open to research internship opportunities for the Summer of 2021 where I would like to apply my acquired knowledge gained so far from Academic, Industry, Leadership, and Research experiences and contribute to the team to the best of my abilities. You can reach out to me via email at sai.kuheli@gmail.com with any advisement, opportunities, collaboration, and/or concerns. Thank you.
